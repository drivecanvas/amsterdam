      <p class="fs-16 sm-fs-18 md-fs-24 fw-300 grey3 mb-l">At Canvas, our mission is simple: rethink car ownership to meet the needs of the modern day driver. But what does that even mean?</p>
      <p class="measure"> With the rise of ridesharing, car sharing, and a variety of other transportation services, there are more options to get you from point A to point B than ever before. However, no one has been able to tackle the longstanding problems associated with car ownership. How can you make owning a car easier and more seamless? That’s what we’re here to do. </p>

          <h3 class="fs-24 fw-300 mb-m"> Flexibility </h3>
          <p>Flexibility is our guiding principle. We’re here to provide ownership options that match your needs—whatever they may be—without breaking the bank. It’s our belief that customers shouldn’t need to make multi-year commitments to get 24/7 access to a car.</p>
